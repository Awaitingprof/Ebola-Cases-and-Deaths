# Ebola Cases and Deaths in Affected Countries
This data analysis project focuses on examining Ebola cases and deaths in affected countries. The project utilizes a dataset containing information on various aspects of the Ebola outbreak, including the country, case definition, total cases, cases in the last 21 days, total deaths, and the reported date.

## Dataset Columns
1.	Country: Indicates the country affected by the Ebola outbreak.
2.	Case Definition: Defines the state of the case as confirmed, suspected, probable, or other.
3.	Total Cases: Represents the total number of Ebola cases in the respective country.
4.	Cases Last 21 Days: Indicates if the case has been ongoing for the last 21 days.
5.	Total Deaths: Reflects the total number of deaths caused by Ebola.
6.	Country Reported Date: Specifies the date of the reported case or death in the country.

## Methodology
The project utilizes various data analysis techniques to accomplish its goals. This includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization. SQL, along with Tableau,  employed to perform the analysis and generate meaningful visualizations.
Results and Findings
The findings of this project will be documented and presented in a clear and concise manner. The analysis will provide insights into the distribution and trends of Ebola cases and deaths in affected countries. It will also highlight any notable patterns or relationships between case definitions, total cases, and other variables.

## Usage
The project's GitHub repository contains the dataset used, as well as the source code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The code is written in SQL and can be easily replicated or modified for further exploration. The dataset itself can serve as a valuable resource for researchers, health professionals, and anyone interested in studying the Ebola outbreak.

## Future Work
Although this project focuses on the existing dataset, there are several avenues for further investigation. Future work could include incorporating additional data sources to enhance the analysis, considering demographic or socioeconomic factors that may influence the outbreak, and comparing the Ebola outbreak to other infectious diseases for a comprehensive perspective.
